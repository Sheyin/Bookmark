<h1>Bookmark...er</h1>

The goal of this is to learn how to use MongoDB and Flask.  It organizes my bookmarks by tags and add some additional features.  It uses MongoDB to store the information, and Flask to provide the interface.

I have some theoretical features down the line (snapshots, checking url validity, discord integration, etc) but starting with the basics first.
