Bookmark...er

The goal of this is to organize my bookmarks by tags and add some additional features.  It uses MongoDB to store the information, and flask to provide the interface.

I have some theoretical features down the line (snapshots, checking url validity, discord integration, etc) but starting with the basics first.
