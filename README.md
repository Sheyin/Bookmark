<h1>Bookmark...er</h1>

The goal of this is to practice Python and learn how to use MongoDB and Flask.  It organizes bookmarks by tags and add some additional features.  It uses MongoDB to store the information, and Flask to provide the interface.  Requires Python 3 and pymongo.

I have some theoretical features down the line (snapshots, checking url validity, discord integration, etc) but starting with the basics first.
