<h1>Bookmark...er</h1>

The goal of this is to practice Python and learn how to use MongoDB and Flask.  It organizes bookmarks by tags and add some additional features.  It uses MongoDB to store the information, and Flask to provide the interface.  

<h2>Files:</h2>

Included in the repository are the python / html files used by Flask.

<h2>Required:</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Python 3
<li>pyMongo
<li>Flask
<li>mongoDB
</ul>

<h2>Current State: </h2>

Adding and searching bookmarks are <i>mostly</i> working now but there are some bugs.  Categories need to be fixed so that it correctly stores multiple categories as seperate strings, and filtering out duplicates needs to be tweaked.

<h2>Future:</h2>

I have some theoretical features down the line (snapshots, checking url validity, discord integration, etc) but starting with the basics first.
